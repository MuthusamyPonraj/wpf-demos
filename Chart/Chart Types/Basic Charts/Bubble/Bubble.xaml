<Paragraph>
Bubble chart is an extension of the Scatter chart (or XY-chart) where each data point is represented by a circle. But here the circle size determined based on Size property. Consequently, bubble charts allow three-variable comparisons for easy visualization of complex interdependencies that are not apparent in two-variable charts.
