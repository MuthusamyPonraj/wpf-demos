           This sample showcases the incremental loading capabilities of SfDataGrid. Incremental loading allows you to load a set of data from whole data source to SfDataGrid and it provides support with fast and fluid scrolling and loading the huge set of data. You can enable incremental loading in SfDataGrid by creating a data source with IncrementalList class which implements the ISupportIncrementalLoading interface internally. In this, Sorting, Filtering, Grouping and Summaries will be applied only for loaded data.
