           This sample showcases real time updates capability of SfDataGrid. SfDataGrid has a high performance standard, where you can make the grid to work with large amounts of data with few property settings, without a performance hit. It provides complete support for Virtual Mode, where the data will be loaded only on demand and thus saves the memory consumption and provides quick response. It also handles very high frequency updates and refresh scenarios.
