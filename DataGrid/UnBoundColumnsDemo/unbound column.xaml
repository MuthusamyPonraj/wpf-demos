           This sample showcases the unbound column capability of SfDataGrid. SfDataGrid supports the addition of extra columns to the data source columns. These additional columns are called as unbound columns, as they do not belong to the data source. Unbound column has two features like Expression and Format and these unbound fields are used when you want to add additional or custom information to each record. An unbound column is sorted, grouped, and filtered like other GridColumns.
