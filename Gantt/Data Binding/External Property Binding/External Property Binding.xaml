            Any external class collection can be bound to the Gantt control by mapping its attributes. Mapping can be done between the TaskAttributeMapping of Gantt and the attributes of external class. When a task node position changes, its corresponding data in the grid will automatically get updated and also the underlying source will get updated. This sample showcases how the Gantt control accepts an external collection as a data source.
