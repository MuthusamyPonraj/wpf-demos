            This sample showcases the following capabilities of GridControl such as the use of Combo Box, Drop-Down, and Multicolumn Grid list controls in Grid cells. The various options illustrated include AutoComplete functionality, getting items for the drop-down from either a string collection or a LINQ source, and using the drop-down in a foreign-key manner. For example, displaying one column from a data source in the drop-down while saving the cell value from another column in the data source.
