            This sample of GridControl showcases the Freeze Pane feature . This enables you to freeze a part of the grid on screen, so that you can see the frozen area, even when you scroll through the other part independently. The Freeze Pane feature is frequently used to keep a set of title cells in view as data scrolls through or next to it.
