<Paragraph>
This sample showcases a Virtual Cell architecture in GridControl where the cell contents are drawn statically until a live cell is needed. For example, when you hover the mouse over the grid, the cells under the mouse pointer need to handle the mouse inputs dynamically as needed. The static cells are turned into "live cells" that can handle the mouse interactions. These live cells stay in scope until they are no longer needed, which is usually when they are scrolled off screen. Using static drawing for cells, and thus minimizing the need for large numbers of live cells, provides an optimal way to display large data sources very quickly.
